        "# EyeLevel - A Comprehensive Guide\n",
        "*Updated 2024-8-22*\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is designed to help you use and fully understand EyeLevel's tools. For support feel free to either contact daniel.warfield@eyelevel.ai (the author) or support@eyelevel.ai (general technical support).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is EyeLevel?\n",
        "\n",
        "EyeLevel is a set of unified technologies which are designed to allow you to parse and search through documents. This can be used in many applications, including:\n",
        "- Finding references within a large document set\n",
        "- Performing retreival augmented generation\n",
        "- Reformatting visually dense documents into a useful textual representation\n",
        "\n",
        "Eyelevel has two core technologies: GroundX and X-Ray.\n",
        "\n",
        "X-Ray is a modern take on document parsing: it uses a variety of computer vision and natural language processing techniques to turn documents (even those with complex formatting,) into a textual representation we call a \"semantic object\". Semantic objects contain key information about the document, sections of the document, and elements within the document in order to provide highly contextualized and useful representations of the source material.\n",
        "\n",
        "GroundX uses the semantic objects created by X-Ray to perform search. You can put a natural language question into GroundX and you'll get back a list of semantic objects, generated with X-Ray based on your documents, which are relevent to your question.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How does X-Ray work?\n",
        "\n",
        "We created a fine tuned vision model which is specifically designed to identify key elements within documents. We observe a variety of element types, but predominately concern ourselves with text, tables, and graphical figures. Once these elements have been identified they are extracted from the document and sent to a pipeliene depending on the type of element. Text is simply extracted while tables and images are grounded within a textual representation via fine tuned multimodal LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once all elements within a document are identified, extracted, and grounded textually, X-Ray constructs a summarization on a document and section level based on the extracted textual representations. This allows X-Ray to create a representation of the greater document context, which is used to build semantic objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use extracted text from the elements, as well as summary level information, to identify key ideas within the document. These ideas might encompass one or many extracted elements. We use the extracted data to construct a template of key information which needs to be filled in order to fully describe the identified ideas within the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the document has been devided into ideas, and templates including what is needed to describe those ideas are generated, the templates are filled out via yet another fine tuned LLM. This, ultimately, is what becomes a semantic object. All models used in this process exist within EyeLevel's cloud, and can be deployed to a VPC as an atomic unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How does GroundX work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because X-Ray creates highly queryable semantic objects, GroundX search does not use the traditional cosine-similarity flavor of vector search common in many similar retreival systems. Rather, GroundX employs a customized textual search strategy built on top of Apache Lucene, Lucene being designed for indexing and searching textual data. We employ a configured variety of Apache Lucene enabled search which is specifically designed to be maximally compatible with the semantic objects output by X-Ray.\n",
        "\n",
        "The validity of this approach is supported [in literature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14963) and also has a variety of practical benifits which allow for the optimization of GroundX on a case by case basis with minimal overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a lot of nitty gritty engineering that goes into this, which is the cumulative experience of eyelevel working with numerous companies across a diverse spread of documents. What we settled on is a complex multi-field filter and search which prioritizes certain elements in the semantic object, and certain tokens within those elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "All of eyelevels technologies (including X-Ray) can be accessed via the GroundX SDK, which is essentially a collection of language specific implementations and CURL accessible API endpoints. The documentation for the API can be found here:\n",
        "\n",
        "https://documentation.eyelevel.ai/reference/\n",
        "\n",
        "The most fundamental component of organization within GroundX is the bucket, which is used to store documents. When you upload a document to a bucket it will trigger X-Ray parsing, and the result will be stored on the bucket for later querying. The semantic objects which X-Ray creates are ultimately what is stored in a bucket.\n",
        "\n",
        "Projects are collections of buckets, allowing you to search between multiple buckets. This can allow you to organize information across buckets, and aggregate that information for specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Buckets and Projects can be searched against based on a natural language query. GroundX will search for the most relevent semantic objects which match your query and return them. GroundX will also construct a recomended text block which aggregates information from the most relevent retreived semantic objects. This is designed to be injected into a language model, enabling RAG esque qorkflows. We'll explore, in depth, the results of search later in the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Optimizing for Your Documents\n",
        "\n",
        "While EyeLevel's products are designed to work out of the box on arbitrary human documents, in reality it's impossible to make a single unified system that is perfect in every use case. One of the core ideas of both X-Ray and GroundX is an element of configurability: We can fine tune computer vision models on your documents, we can adjust templating to match your needs, and we can modify our search system based on your specific requirments. We also have a depth of experience in analyzing and testing the performance of RAG systems in real world use cases. The takeaway is that X-Ray + GroundX allows you to acheive state of the art performance out of the box on a wide range of common document types, and can be tailored to perform exelently to your documents if necessary.\n",

For example, a study by Emma Strubell, Ananya Ganesh, and Andrew McCallum highlighted the impacts of training natural language processing (NLP) models in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint. Another study by Roy Schwartz, Jesse Dodge, Noah A. Smith, and Oren Etzioni proposed the concept of Green AI. Additionally, the AI community has created several tools to evaluate machine learning energy consumption.\\n\\nThese impacts are mainly expressed in terms of energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet, as we will discuss later, this energy consumption represents only a part of the complete environmental impacts of such methods. For example, a study by David Rolnick et al. states that \"it is in terms of their indirect effects on the global digital sector that AI systems will have a major impact on the environment.\" In the same spirit, another study by Karen Hao warns that \"optimizing actions for a restricted set of parameters (profit, job security, etc.) without consideration of these wider impacts can lead to consequences for the environment.\"\\n\\nJulien Lefèvre\\nUniversité d\\'Aix-Marseille, CNRS, Centrale Marseille\\nMarseille, France\\nJacques Combaz  \\nUniversité Grenoble Alpes, VERIMAG  \\nGrenoble, France\\n\\nEvaluating the impacts of an AI service is not fundamentally different from evaluating another digital service. However, AI presents specificities that must be taken into account because they increase its environmental impacts.\\n\\nFirst, AI, and in particular deep learning methods, usually require large quantities of data. These data have to be acquired, transferred, stored, and processed. All these steps require equipment and energy, and have environmental impacts. For example, in the case of a surveillance satellite, the data will probably be in large quantities, but the number of acquisition devices may be limited. In contrast, in the case of a smart building infrastructure, the data may be in smaller quantities, but many devices will be required.\\n\\nTraining deep neural models also takes a lot of computation time and resources, partly because the model itself learns a comprehensive representation that enables it to better analyze the data.

LCA dimensions:** The first dimension corresponds to the phases of the life cycle, and the second one pertains to the environmental impacts (see section 3 for more details on this last dimension). The assessment should be consistent with the goal and scope of the LCA study. Therefore, the costs must consider at least the criteria that the AI solution aims to address in the context of AI for Green. For instance, if the AI solution is applied to reduce energy consumption, the main expected gain will likely be in terms of carbon footprint, so at least the carbon footprint of using the model should be considered. For an application monitoring biodiversity, the most relevant criterion may be natural biotic resources (and not carbon footprint), which include wild animals, plants, etc.\\n\\nFigure 1 summarizes these two dimensions. As previously stated in the literature, only part of the global warming potential due to the use phase has generally been considered when evaluating AI, which corresponds to the shaded area in the figure.\\n\\n**3.2 Life cycle assessment methodology for AI:**\\nIn this section, we focus on the life cycle assessment of the AI solution and the associated ICT equipment. We aim to propose a methodology for applying the general framework of LCA to AI services. For LCA of all other processes, we refer to LCA standards and sources such as [15]. To concretely apply the methodology presented for an AI service, we use the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendation [20] for the environmental evaluation of ICT.\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\nFigure 2 shows two sides of the life cycle of an artificial intelligence (AI) service. \\n\\nThe top part of this figure shows the different tasks involved in an AI service from a software point of view (data acquisition, ..., inference). For each task, one or several devices are used. \\n\\nThe bottom part of the figure shows the life cycle phases of each of these devices from a hardware point of view. The environmental impacts of the AI service will stem from the life cycle phases of the devices. Note that all devices involved in the AI tasks should be taken into account.\\n\\n**Remark on terminology:** In the paper, the term \"Use phase\" refers to the use phase of the life cycle of equipment, corresponding to the devices provided for the AI service (box \"Use of device\" in the lower part of Figure 2). We call \"Application phase\" the inference phase of the AI service (green box in the upper part of Figure 2).\\n\\nConcerning the system boundaries, we refer to [1] to consider the equipment for three tiers:\\n\\n1. **Terminals:** In the case of the smart building, this can include:\\n   - User terminals used to develop, train, and use the AI service.\\n   - Terminals in the facility where the AI service is trained, dedicated to IT support.\\n   - Smart thermostats.\\n\\n2. **Network:** For the smart building case, network equipment used for training the AI model in the facility, and network equipment in the buildings where the thermostats are used.\\n\\n3. **Data center/server:** For the smart building case, servers on which the model is trained and used; training and inference can be done on the same server or not.\\n\\nFor each tier, all support equipment and activities may also be considered. For example, the power supply unit and HVAC of the data center should be taken into account.\\n\\nThe life cycle stages to consider are the ones previously mentioned: production, use, and end of life. In particular, [20] and [1] give classifications of unit processes according to the life cycle stages, which can be applied to AI services, as shown in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1.

The goal of a life cycle assessment consists in computing the sum of the environmental flows of the system associated with a functional unit. To be concrete, if one considers a heating system in a smart building, the functional unit could be \"heating 1m² to 20°C for one year.\"\\n\\nOf course, very often, the LCI does not correspond exactly to the functional unit. The size of economic flows may not match (e.g., the functional unit may partially use shared servers and sensors), and a process may be multifunctional, i.e., producing flows of different types at the same time (e.g., storage capacity and computational power). Both these problems can be solved using, for instance, allocation methods according to a key. A typical allocation key for network infrastructures would be the volume of data. For a data center, it could be the economic value of storage and computational services when they cannot be physically isolated.\\nEven though Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is widely used in many domains, it has rarely been applied to AI services.\\n\\n**3. Life Cycle Assessment of an AI Solution**\\n\\nWhen it comes to quantifying the impacts of digital technologies, particularly AI technologies, one faces several methodological choices that require a specific definition of the studied system. For instance, assessing the global impacts of the AI domain—if we could precisely circumscribe it—is not the same as assessing the impacts of an AI algorithm or service. The emerging field of AI\\'s impacts quantification still suffers from a lack of common methodology, and it very often focuses only on the Use phase of devices involved in an AI service. To perform meaningful quantification, we strongly suggest following the general framework of life cycle assessment (LCA, detailed in Section 3.2). We will show how it can be adapted to an AI service, i.e., in this case, a deep learning code used either alone or in a larger application.\\n\\nAI, being part of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, and following the taxonomies from references [18, 19], its impacts can be divided into first-, second-, and third-order impacts. In this section, we focus only on first-order impacts, while we will discuss second and third orders in Sections 4 and 5.\\n\\nWe will use the term AI service for all the equipment (sensors, servers, etc.) used by the AI, and the term AI solution for the complete application using AI. In the case of the smart building, the AI solution is the smart building itself, while the AI service is the digital equipment needed for the smart infrastructure.\\n\\n**3.1 First-Order Impacts of an AI Service**\\n\\nFirst-order or direct impacts of the AI service are the impacts due to the different life cycle phases of the equipment:\\n\\n- Raw material extraction, which encompasses all the industrial processes involved in the transformation from ore to metals;\\n\\nManufacturing, which includes the processes that create the equipment from the raw material;\\n\\n• Transport, which includes all transport processes involved, including product distribution;\\n\\n• Use, which includes mostly the energy consumption of equipment while it is being used;\\n\\n• and End of life, which refers to the processes to dismantle, recycle, and/or dispose of the equipment.\\n\\nFor simplicity reasons, we will merge the first three items into a single production phase in the rest of the paper.\\n\\nFor example, an AI solution in a smart building may need sensors and servers that require resources and energy for their production, operation, and end of life.\\n\\nA second dimension is necessary to assess the impacts, a set of environmental criteria considered. Indeed, each life cycle phase has impacts on different environmental indicators: Greenhouse Gases emissions (usually expressed as Global Warming Potential, GWP), water footprint, human toxicity, or abiotic resource depletion (ADP) for instance. In general, evaluating the environmental impact of a service requires multiple impact criteria [20]. ISO states that \"the selection of impact categories shall reflect a comprehensive set of environmental issues related to the product system being studied, taking the goal and scope into consideration.\" Additionally, \"the selection of impact categories, indicators, and models...\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\nThe following text has been analyzed and minimally enhanced for clarity while preserving the original text formatting, spacing, and lists.

Yet, when trying to assess this phase for deep learning methods, we are faced with a lack of Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) for Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) (or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) or equivalents). Reference [5] showed that for a Central Processing Unit (CPU)-only data center in France, around 40% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the equipment were due to the production phase.\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\n{\"summary\": \"The following table contains the life cycle stages (production, use, end of life) and their associated environmental impacts (ADP, humtox, water, GWP) for AI services.\"}\\n\\n{\"production\": \"\", \"use\": \"\", \"end of life\": \"\", \"ADP\": \"\"}\\n\\n{\"production\": \"\", \"use\": \"\", \"end of life\": \"\", \"humtox\": \"\"}\\n\\n{\"production\": \"\", \"use\": \"\", \"end of life\": \"\", \"water\": \"\"}\\n\\n{\"production\": \"\", \"use\": \"\", \"end of life\": \"\", \"GWP\": \"\"}\\n\\nThis table represents the life cycle stages, including production, use, and end of life, and their associated environmental impacts such as ADP, humtox, water, and GWP for AI services.\\n\\nFor the row corresponding to ADP, the values are as follows: production is empty, use is empty, end of life is empty, and ADP is empty.\\n\\nFor the row corresponding to humtox, the values are as follows: production is empty, use is empty, end of life is empty, and humtox is empty.\\n\\nFor the row corresponding to water, the values are as follows: production is empty, use is empty, end of life is empty, and water is empty.\\n\\nFor the row corresponding to GWP, the values are as follows: production is empty, use is empty, end of life is empty, and GWP is empty.\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\nThe following text:\\n\\n2022  \\nApr  \\n21  \\n]  \\ncs.AI  \\n[  \\n2110.11822v2  \\n: arXiv  \\nUnraveling the Hidden Environmental Impacts of AI  \\nSolutions for Environment  \\nLife Cycle Assessment of AI Solutions  \\n\\nAnne-Laure Ligozat  \\nUniversity of Paris-Saclay, LIMSI, CNRS, ENSIIE  \\nOrsay, France  \\n\\nAurélie Bugeau  \\nUniversity of Bordeaux, Bordeaux INP, CNRS, Laboratoire LaBRI  \\nTalence, France  \\n\\n**Abstract**  \\nIn the past ten years, artificial intelligence has encountered such dramatic progress that it is now seen as a tool of choice to solve environmental issues, particularly greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). At the same time, the deep learning community began to realize that training models with more and more parameters requires a lot of energy and, as a consequence, results in GHG emissions. To our knowledge, questioning the complete net environmental impacts of AI solutions for the environment (AI for Green), and not only GHG, has never been addressed directly. In this article, we propose to study the possible negative impacts of AI for Green. First, we review the different types of AI impacts, then we present the different methodologies used to assess those impacts, and show how to apply life cycle assessment to AI services. Finally, we discuss how to assess the environmental usefulness of a general AI service and point out the limitations of existing work in AI for Green.\\n\\n**Introduction**\\nIn the past few years, the artificial intelligence (AI) community has begun to address the environmental impacts of deep learning programs. For example, a study by Emma Strubell, Ananya Ganesh, and Andrew McCallum highlighted the impacts of training natural language processing (NLP) models in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint. Another study by Roy Schwartz, Jesse Dodge, Noah A. Smith, and Oren Etzioni proposed the concept of Green AI. Additionally, the AI community has created several tools to evaluate machine learning energy consumption.\\n\\nThese impacts are mainly expressed in terms of energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet, as we will discuss later, this energy consumption represents only a part of the complete environmental impacts of such methods. For example, a study by David Rolnick et al. states that \"it is in terms of their indirect effects on the global digital sector that AI systems will have a major impact on the environment.\" In the same spirit, another study by Karen Hao warns that \"optimizing actions for a restricted set of parameters (profit, job security, etc.) without consideration of these wider impacts can lead to consequences for the environment.\"\\n\\nJulien Lefèvre\\nUniversité d\\'Aix-Marseille, CNRS, Centrale Marseille\\nMarseille, France\\nJacques Combaz  \\nUniversité Grenoble Alpes, VERIMAG  \\nGrenoble, France\\n\\nEvaluating the impacts of an AI service is not fundamentally different from evaluating another digital service. However, AI presents specificities that must be taken into account because they increase its environmental impacts.\\n\\nFirst, AI, and in particular deep learning methods, usually require large quantities of data. These data have to be acquired, transferred, stored, and processed. All these steps require equipment and energy, and have environmental impacts. For example, in the case of a surveillance satellite, the data will probably be in large quantities, but the number of acquisition devices may be limited. In contrast, in the case of a smart building infrastructure, the data may be in smaller quantities, but many devices will be required.\\n\\nTraining deep neural models also takes a lot of computation time and resources, partly because the model itself learns a comprehensive representation that enables it to better analyze the data. Whereas with other models, a human will provide part of this information, often in the form of a handcrafted solution. The computation cost can be even higher if the model does continuous learning.\\n\\nAt the same time, AI\\'s popularity is increasing, and AI is often presented as a solution to environmental problems with AI for Green proposals. The negative environmental impacts can be briefly evoked, and in particular, rebound effects where unitary efficiency gains can lead to global greenhouse gas (GHG) increases. However, no quantification of all AI\\'s environmental costs is proposed to close the loop between AI for Green and Green AI. That is why it is even more important to be able to assess the actual impacts, taking into account both positive and negative effects.\\nIncidentally, those works often use the term Artificial Intelligence (AI) to actually refer to deep learning methods, even though AI has a much wider scope with at least two major historical trends [9]. In this paper, we will also focus on deep learning methods, which pose specific environmental issues, and as we have seen, are often presented as possible solutions to environmental problems. We describe these impacts and discuss how to take them into account.\\n\\nOur contributions are the following:\\n\\n1. We review the existing work to assess the environmental impacts of AI and show their limitations (Sections 2.1 and 2.2).\\n2. We present life cycle assessment (Section 2.3) and examine how it can comprehensively evaluate the direct environmental impacts of an AI service (Section 3).\\n3. We discuss how to assess the environmental value of an AI service designed for environmental purposes (Section 4).\\n4. We argue that although improving the state of the art, the proposed methodology can only show the technical potential of a service, which may not fully realize in a real-life context (Section 5).\\n\\n**2 Related Work**\\n\\nThis section reviews existing tools for evaluating the environmental impacts of AI as well as green applications of AI. It ends with an introduction to life cycle assessment, a well-founded methodology for environmental impact assessment but still not used for AI services.\\n\\n**2.1 Carbon Footprint of AI**\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\nThe following text discusses the environmental impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, particularly during the training phase. \\n\\nStrubell et al. [29] has received much attention because it revealed a dramatic impact of NLP algorithms in the training phase: the authors found greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be equivalent to 300 flights between New York and San Francisco. Premises of such an approach were already present in [23] for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with less meaningful metrics (energy per image or power with no indications on the global duration).\\n\\nIn [28], the authors observe a more general exponential evolution in deep learning architecture parameters. Therefore, they promote \"Green AI\" to consider energy efficiency at the same level as accuracy in training models and recommend, in particular, to report floating-point operations. Other authors [13] have also reviewed all the methods to estimate energy consumption from computer architecture. They distinguish between different levels of description, software/hardware level, instruction/application level, and they consider how those methods can be applied to monitor training and inference phases in machine learning.\\n\\nIn the continuity of [29] and [28], several tools have been proposed to make the impacts of training models more visible. They can be schematically divided into:\\n• Integrated tools, such as Experiment Impact Tracker [17], Carbon Tracker [2], and CodeCarbon.\\nThe following text discusses various tools and methodologies for measuring the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with AI technologies. It mentions Python packages such as:\\n\\n- [Experiment Impact Tracker](https://github.com/Breakend/experiment-impact-tracker)\\n- [Carbontracker](https://github.com/lfwa/carbontracker)\\n- [CodeCarbon](https://codecarbon.io/)\\n\\nThese packages report measured energy consumption and the associated carbon footprint.\\n\\nAdditionally, it references online tools like Green Algorithms and ML CO2 Impact, which require only a few parameters such as training duration, material, and location but are less accurate.\\n\\nThe text highlights that AI literature often addresses only a small part of direct impacts and neglects production and end-of-life phases, thus not following certain recommendations. For instance, a study cited as [14] points out the methodological gaps in previous studies focusing on the use phase. It mentions that manufacturing could account for about 75% of the total emissions of products like an Apple device or an iPhone 5, based on a life cycle methodology and sustainability reports using the GHG protocol standard.\\n\\nAnother study, referenced as [24], provides a list of carbon emission sources of an AI service, offering a more comprehensive view of direct impacts in terms of carbon footprint. The text also advocates for considering indirect impacts, such as behavioral or societal changes due to AI, when evaluating AI services.\\n\\nSome works focus on optimizing AI processes regarding runtime, energy consumption, or carbon footprint. For example, a study referenced as [25] updates results from [29] and reveals a significant reduction in GHG impact by a factor of 100 when considering the location of the data center (using low-carbon energy) and the architecture of the deep network (sparsity). However, this study evaluates only the GHG emissions of operating computers and data centers, excluding the production and end-of-life phases, and considers a highly optimized use case that may not represent real scenarios.\\n\\nThe energy efficiency of machine learning has also been the subject of dedicated workshops.\\n\\n2.2 AI for Green benefits\\nWhen designing an AI for Green method, i.e., a method using AI to reduce energy consumption or to benefit other environmental indicators, the complete impacts of AI should also be considered to build meaningful costs/benefits assessments. \\n\\n[7] proposes a framework for such cost-benefit analysis of AI foundation models to evaluate environmental and societal trade-offs. We discuss this framework in Section 4. Most AI solutions for the environment lack a rigorous evaluation of the cost/benefit balance, and one of our contributions is to advance this issue.\\n\\n4. http://www.green-algorithms.org/\\n5. https://mlco2.github.io/impact/#compute\\n6. Workshop on Energy Efficient Machine Learning and Cognitive Computing, https://www.emc2-ai.org/virtual-21\\n\\n2.3 Life Cycle Assessment\\n\\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely recognized methodology for environmental impact assessment, with ISO standards (ISO 14040 and 14044) and a specific methodology standard for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) from the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) [20]. It quantifies multiple environmental criteria and covers the different life cycle phases of a target system. \\n\\n[15] clearly states that \"to avoid the often seen problem shifting where solutions to a problem create several new and often ignored problems, these decisions must take a systems perspective. They must consider [...] the life cycle of the solution, and they need to consider all the relevant impacts caused by the solution.\" The LCA theoretical approach exposed in [16] describes the system of interest as a collection of building blocks called unit processes, for example, \"Use phase of the server\" on which the model is trained. The set of all unit processes is called the technosphere, as opposed to the ecosphere. Each unit process can be expressed in terms of flows of two kinds:\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\n{\"summary\": \"The following table contains the life cycle stages and unit processes for evaluating the environmental impact of ICT equipment and AI services.

For example, [8] presents an intelligent control system that takes into account the expected occupancy in order to adapt the thermostat and save energy. They do not take into account learning the occupancy model but consider the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the smart thermostats and show that the energy needed for these devices across their whole life cycle will almost always be lower than the energy saved.\\n\\n**Discussion**\\n\\nIn this paper, we have analyzed the environmental impacts of AI solutions, particularly in the case of AI for Green applications, and proposed a framework to evaluate them more completely. The proposed methodology compares, through life cycle assessment, the impact of a reference solution with the AI one for the appropriate types of environmental impacts. The analysis of literature on AI solutions has highlighted the following issues/problems.\\n\\n**5.1 Current environmental evaluation of AI services is under-estimated**\\n\\nWe have shown that AI for Green papers only take into account a small part of the direct environmental impacts. Several reasons can explain this under-estimation. The narratives about dematerialization that would correspond to a dramatic decrease in environmental impacts permeate AI as a part of information and communication technology (ICT) [6]. However, these narratives have proven to be false until now. Attention to AI\\'s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has focused on electricity consumption (energy flows). At the moment, material flows receive less attention in AI. However, it is beginning to be considered [14].\\n\\n**5.2 AI research should use Life Cycle Assessment to assess the usefulness of an AI service**\\n\\nThe following text emphasizes the importance of using life cycle assessment (LCA) in AI research to evaluate the overall usefulness and environmental impact of AI services.\\nThe following text discusses the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) as a methodology to evaluate not only global warming potential but also other direct environmental impacts. LCA considers all steps from production to use and end of life. However, it has several well-known limitations due to the complexity of processes involved in material production. Obtaining all the information to assign reliable values to each edge of the life cycle inventory also proves difficult. For example, there is very little information on the manufacturing impacts of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) either from manufacturers or in LCA databases. To solve this problem, we could encourage the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community to lobby companies to open a part of their data. This approach would be in the same spirit as what is happening for open science but would also require taking legal issues into account.\\n\\n**5.3 AI for Green gains are only potential**\\n\\nEven when a properly conducted LCA concludes that an AI solution is environmentally beneficial, such a result should be considered with caution. Environmental benefits computed by the LCA-based methodology proposed in this paper correspond to a technical and simplistic view of environmental problems: it assumes that AI will enhance or replace existing applications, all other things being equal. The ambition to solve societal problems using AI is praiseworthy, but it should probably be accompanied by socio-technical concerns and an evaluation of possible third-order effects. For example, autonomous vehicles are often associated with potential efficiency gains (such as helping car sharing, or allowing platooning) and corresponding environmental benefits. However, autonomy could also profoundly transform mobility in a non-ecological way.\\n\\n**Abbreviations:**\\n- AI: Artificial Intelligence\\n- CNN: Convolutional Neural Network\\n- CPU: Central Processing Unit\\n- DL: Deep Learning\\n- GHG: Greenhouse Gas\\n- GPU: Graphics Processing Unit\\n- HVAC: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning\\n- ICT: Information and Communications Technology\\n- LCA: Life Cycle Assessment or Analysis\\n- LCI: Life Cycle Inventory\\n- ML: Machine Learning\\n- NLP: Natural Language Processing\\n\\n**5.4 AI services and large deployment**\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\nThe following text is a list of references from a document discussing the environmental impacts of AI technologies and their role in sustainability.

First, in the equation, all values are expressed in dollars. This formally allows the addition of several kinds of impacts but arbitrarily considers the diversity of environmental issues. By definition, LCA considers multiple criteria for impacts, previously described at the beginning of Section 3 (greenhouse gas emissions, water footprint, etc.). LCA may aggregate several impacts but with specific weights not necessarily dependent on economic value. As noted in [15], \"there is no scientific basis on which to reduce the results of an LCA to a single result or score because of the underlying ethical value-choices.\"\\n\\nFor instance, if one considers an AI service dedicated to biodiversity (see for instance Section 8.1 in [26]), one would expect to precisely quantify the positive impact of this service on biodiversity (schematically, how many species can be saved?) balanced by the negative impacts (producing chips for GPUs has an impact on biodiversity through several sources of pollution [31]). Adopting Equation (2) will mix several impacts together and may dilute the value of interest (e.g., biodiversity), which could be burdened by negative impacts regarding energy to train the models, for instance.\\nThe following text discusses the evaluation of AI solutions using specific equations and methodologies. It critiques an existing equation from a referenced source, suggesting that while the equation is not incorrect, its expression in terms of benefits and costs is questionable, and practical means for its computation are missing.\\n\\nThe text then proposes using Equation (1) and relates the terms of Equation (2) to the methodology proposed in the paper as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[ V(M2) = S(M2 | M1) - E(M2) - O(M2) - A(M2 | M1) - LCA_{AI}(M2) \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( A(M2 | M1) \\\\) and \\\\( LCA_{AI}(M2) \\\\) are defined in Equation (1). The negative impacts of an AI solution \\\\( M2 \\\\) compared to the reference solution \\\\( M1 \\\\) are not always restricted to its AI part (i.e., to \\\\( E(M2) \\\\) and \\\\( O(M2) \\\\)). For example, compared to a standard vehicle, the negative impacts of an autonomous vehicle are not only due to the life cycle of additional ICT equipment but also to additional aerodynamic drag due to the presence of LIDAR on the roof. Hence, the nature of the impacts in \\\\( S(M2 | M1) \\\\) (positive or negative) cannot be stated a priori and depends on complete life cycle assessment (LCA) results for both applications \\\\( M2 \\\\) and \\\\( M1 \\\\). It may also depend on the target environmental criteria.\\n\\n4.2 Case studies\\nIn order to review the kind of evaluation that is usually made in the AI for Green literature, we analyzed the references for several domains of [26], which identifies potential applications of machine learning for climate change adaptation or mitigation.\\n\\nWe mostly chose domains that had been flagged as having a High Leverage and noted for each paper cited in the corresponding section the kind of environmental evaluation, with the following categories:\\n\\na. No mention of the environmental gain.\\nb. General mention of the environmental gain.\\nc. A few words about the environmental gain but no quantitative evaluation or only indirect estimation.\\nd. Evaluation of the energy gain without taking the AI service into account.\\ne. Evaluation of the energy gain taking the use phase of the AI service into account.\\nf. Comprehensive evaluation of the environmental gain (comparison of LCAs).\\n\\nThe results of the review are shown in Figure 4.\\n\\nThe central node is \"Rolnick et al. citations.\" On its left are the domains of the citations. For example, the Smart building section contained 15 relevant citations.\\n\\nOn its right, the first flows show the partition into general machine learning applications (ML), deep learning applications (DL), and other methods (other). For example, 20 papers corresponded to deep learning applications.\\n\\nThe last flows on the right show the kinds of environmental evaluation. We can note that about half of the papers do not include any environmental evaluation, although the focus is on applications to tackle climate change. Many papers also give a distant proxy for evaluation, such as detailing the possible impacts without quantification, or indicating the execution time of the program.\\n\\nA few citations evaluate the environmental gain, mostly in terms of energy gain, but none of the papers considered took into account the AI service impacts.\\n\\nThis review was documented in a CSV file, which is given as supplementary material to the paper.\\n\\n\\nText Excerpt:\\n{\"type\": \"Sankey Diagram\", \"title\": \"Figure 4.

This case requires special attention even in life cycle assessment (LCA), since large-scale deployment may induce societal reorganizations for producing and operating the solution(s). For example, the generalization of artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to a substantial increase in demand for specific materials (such as lithium or cobalt) or energy. This increase may have non-linear environmental consequences, such as opening new and less efficient mines, increasing the use of fossil fuel-based power plants, etc. Hence, in this case, the attributional LCA framework we suggest using in this paper needs to be replaced by the much more complex consequential one [15].\\n\\n**Authors\\' Contribution**\\n- Conceptualization: All authors\\n- Methodology: All authors\\n- Validation: All authors\\n- Formal analysis: All authors\\n- Investigation: Julien Lefèvre and Anne-Laure Ligozat\\n- Data curation: Julien Lefèvre and Anne-Laure Ligozat\\n- Writing—original draft preparation: All authors\\n- Writing—review and editing: All authors\\n- Visualization: Aurélie Bugeau and Anne-Laure Ligozat\\n- Supervision: Anne-Laure Ligozat\\n- Project administration: Anne-Laure Ligozat\\n\\nAll authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\\n\\n**Acknowledgments**\\nThis work was partly supported by the CNRS EcoInfo group (https://ecoinfo.cnrs.fr/).\\n\\n**Abbreviations**\\nThe following abbreviations are used in this manuscript:\\n- TPU: Tensor Processing Unit\\n\\n**References**\\nThe following text provides references to various reports and research papers related to the environmental impacts of digital services, carbon footprint tracking, e-waste, and the rebound effect in energy policy.
