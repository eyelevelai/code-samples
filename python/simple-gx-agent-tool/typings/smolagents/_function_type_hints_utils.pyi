def get_json_schema(func: Callable) -> dict:
    """
    This function generates a JSON schema for a given function, based on its docstring and type hints. This is
    mostly used for passing lists of tools to a chat template. The JSON schema contains the name and description of
    the function, as well as the names, types and descriptions for each of its arguments. `get_json_schema()` requires
    that the function has a docstring, and that each argument has a description in the docstring, in the standard
    Google docstring format shown below. It also requires that all the function arguments have a valid Python type hint.

    Although it is not required, a `Returns` block can also be added, which will be included in the schema. This is
    optional because most chat templates ignore the return value of the function.

    Args:
        func: The function to generate a JSON schema for.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing the JSON schema for the function.

    Examples:
    ```python
    >>> def multiply(x: float, y: float):
    >>>    '''
    >>>    A function that multiplies two numbers
    >>>
    >>>    Args:
    >>>        x: The first number to multiply
    >>>        y: The second number to multiply
    >>>    '''
    >>>    return x * y
    >>>
    >>> print(get_json_schema(multiply))
    {
        "name": "multiply",
        "description": "A function that multiplies two numbers",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "x": {"type": "number", "description": "The first number to multiply"},
                "y": {"type": "number", "description": "The second number to multiply"}
            },
            "required": ["x", "y"]
        }
    }
    ```

    The general use for these schemas is that they are used to generate tool descriptions for chat templates that
    support them, like so:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer
    >>> from transformers.utils import get_json_schema
    >>>
    >>> def multiply(x: float, y: float):
    >>>    '''
    >>>    A function that multiplies two numbers
    >>>
    >>>    Args:
    >>>        x: The first number to multiply
    >>>        y: The second number to multiply
    >>>    return x * y
    >>>    '''
    >>>
    >>> multiply_schema = get_json_schema(multiply)
    >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01")
    >>> messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 179 x 4571?"}]
    >>> formatted_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    >>>     messages,
    >>>     tools=[multiply_schema],
    >>>     chat_template="tool_use",
    >>>     return_dict=True,
    >>>     return_tensors="pt",
    >>>     add_generation_prompt=True
    >>> )
    >>> # The formatted chat can now be passed to model.generate()
    ```

    Each argument description can also have an optional `(choices: ...)` block at the end, such as
    `(choices: ["tea", "coffee"])`, which will be parsed into an `enum` field in the schema. Note that this will
    only be parsed correctly if it is at the end of the line:

    ```python
    >>> def drink_beverage(beverage: str):
    >>>    '''
    >>>    A function that drinks a beverage
    >>>
    >>>    Args:
    >>>        beverage: The beverage to drink (choices: ["tea", "coffee"])
    >>>    '''
    >>>    pass
    >>>
    >>> print(get_json_schema(drink_beverage))
    ```
    {
        'name': 'drink_beverage',
        'description': 'A function that drinks a beverage',
        'parameters': {
            'type': 'object',
            'properties': {
                'beverage': {
                    'type': 'string',
                    'enum': ['tea', 'coffee'],
                    'description': 'The beverage to drink'
                    }
                },
            'required': ['beverage']
        }
    }
